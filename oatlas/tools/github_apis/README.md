# GitHub reverse searches

- GitHub exposes APIs which allows us to get structured responses on publically available repos etc.
- To get started, we can get the user information and all the repos. We'll see about issues and PRs later because those probably require authentication
- We can get the code as well but that also might require authentication. Not sure, we'll see about the hard parts later.
